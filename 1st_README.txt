IMPORTANT NOTE !
----------------

Our main and fastest distribution of WordPress plugin is its own hosting site:

* http://wordpress.org/plugins/d3-simplecharts/

Because (due to history) simpleCharts was named at the beginning there 'd3-simplecharts' you should make sure that this is the name that is existing as your WordPress plugin folder too (eq not 'd3-simpleCharts').

If you downloaded this package from GitHub's tags you will get this folder that is NOT correct. Rename this folder and reactivate plugin and everything should work like a download of WordPress site.

Or you may as well go to WordPress site and download it from there.

Sorry about this little uncomfort of GitHub's distribution !

Thank you.
